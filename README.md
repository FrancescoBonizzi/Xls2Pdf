# Xls2Pdf

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/fbonizzi/GithubOpenSource/_apis/build/status/Xls2Pdf)](https://dev.azure.com/fbonizzi/GithubOpenSource/_build/latest?definitionId=24)

Xls2Pdf is a simple WPF application where you can select multiple Excel files in order to export them individually as Pdf.

Technically speaking:
- I implemented `MVVM` pattern with `MvvmLightLibs`
- To communicate with Excel, I used the COM library `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel`

[An article I wrote on Medium with the explaination of this code](https://medium.com/better-programming/convert-excel-files-into-pdf-in-c-net-5566f170a70e)
